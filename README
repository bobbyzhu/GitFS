A FUSE based filesystem for using Git as a disconnected storage server with local cache.

To mount already existing git repo, run

python GitFS.py <remote-name> <branch> <local_repo_dir> <mount_point>

To unmount use

umount <mount_point>

Still very basic and untested, but as everything it has lofty goals.
It should be usable now.  The important thing to understand is that
currently certain characters are escaped when they appear at the
beginning of a filename.  Currently, the escape character is '@' and
the characters that are escaped are '@' and '.'.  This means that any
files in the git repository that you are mounting that start with '@'
or '.' will not exist in the mounted file system.  This makes it
possible to use git inside of a GitFS file-system.

Currently, any changes are commited after one minute if the repository
is on a reserved subnet, and 10 minutes if the repository is on a
public subnet.  Eventually this should all be configurable via a
configuration file stored under "@gtifs" in the root directory of the
mounted repository.

All the fancy features are relegated to git.  So if you have some idea
for a wiz-bang feature to add, odds are you are better off adding it
to git.

TODO:  Everything.  But in particular:
Finish support programs:
 gmount
 gumount
 gsync -- force a sync outside of GitFS.  Useful to do something like gsync && ssh build-host bash -c 'gsync && make'
 gbuild -- to wrap the above command line into something useable

and of course, lots of debugging.

Other ideas (in no particular order): 
    encryption at the fs level
    allow the local repository to be shallow without all the issues that normally causes (save local space)
    Allow gmount to mount the repsoitory as it was at a certain point in time (auto branch?)
